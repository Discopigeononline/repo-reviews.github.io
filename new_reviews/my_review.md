# Summary

A guide on how to be a Programmer - originally published by Robert L Read

This guide is non-technical and not specific to any programming language, but talks more about progressively higher level goals of being a programmer.  Particularly valuable is the experience shared in the "Advanced" section.

Would highly recommend that data scientists and ML engineers also read through this!
