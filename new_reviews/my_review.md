review_title: Truong's review for Nonlinear Krylov Acceleration repository by Niel Carlson
---
- Please write a thoughtful review.
- The repo NKA is a very useful tool for accelerating convergence of fixed-point (Picard) algorithms. Picards algorithms are widely used in solving nonlinear systems of partial differential equations.
- In most practical problems, nonlinear system of PDEs do not have a closed form solution; therefore, iterative methods can be used to find numerical solutions. However, iterative methods struggle to find the optimal solutions due to slow convergence.
- Thus, Niel Carlson invented this method to accelerate these iterative procedure.
- Some information about the author: Niel Carlson was a research scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He wrote many useful research papers with NKA method being one of them.

- `repository_owner` and `repository_name` **must** reference a real GitHub repo link:
