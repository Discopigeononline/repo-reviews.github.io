Pros
- installation works: I worked through the `Prepare Environment` section of the `README` with no problems
- after working through the README, I was able to produce an animated result.  I honestly wasn't expecting to be successful, so kudos to the repo contributors! 


Cons
- Downloads are large (GIGS) and can be slow- I ran into some errors saying that some of the `download_bashscripts/*.sh` had been downloaded too many times and were not available
- Limited functionality for use in an application, but an interesting research experiment!


Should also make note that it is based on [Tune-a-Video](https://github.com/showlab/Tune-A-Video).
