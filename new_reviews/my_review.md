# Summary

This is a simple README written by Pete Hunt who states:

> There’s a ton of conflicting advice about React out there; why listen to me?
> I was one of the original members of the Facebook team that built and open-sourced React. I’m no longer at Facebook and I’m now at a small startup, so I have a non-Facebook perspective as well.

Reading through it, this was incredibly helpful:

> You should learn, in this order, **without skipping ahead or learning concurrently**:

* React itself
* `npm`
* JavaScript “bundlers
* ES6
* Routing
* Flux
