# Summary

A great introduction to Vim with a quick high-level overview of how it is structured.  Quickly gets into details, so is not a "quickstart" for new users.

For users with some Vim experience, this is a gem.  For new users, you might want to consider tutorials like [https://github.com/iggredible/Learn-Vim](https://github.com/iggredible/Learn-Vim).
