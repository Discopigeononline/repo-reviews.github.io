This repo was built by ex-googler Shaun Wei.  You can buy him a coffee at: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/shaunw he deserves it!

Some of the key contributors:

- https://github.com/lynchee-owo

This is a strong team including people with experience at Google, Uber, and Figma.  I would expect quality to be high and development to be fast.

It looks like public development on this repo started relatively recently, around mid-May 2023.  But there is significant interest and a growing user-base, currently at 1.5k stars and 176 forks.

The RealChar repository is a project that allows you to create, customize and talk to your AI character/companion in real-time using an all-in-one codebase. You can have a natural seamless conversation with AI everywhere (mobile, web, and terminal) using LLM OpenAI GPT3.5/4, Anthropic Claude2, Chroma Vector DB, Whisper Speech2Text, ElevenLabs Text2Speech.

## Pros

- in comparison to other projects, RealChar is:
  - Open source
  - allows open mic conversations
  - allows you to customize the character
  - customizable voice and appearanche
  - supports multiple platforms

- working build and docker instructions!
- tutorial videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q16ZH3kJWxw

## Cons
- if building from source, a substantial list of dependencies increases footprint and likelihood of breakage over time
  - large size dependencies
- currently limited pre-built functionality for voices


## Summary

This is a super cool repo, built by a very talented team.  Since it is in rapid early develoment, expect changes and possible backwards compatibility issues in new releases; ie. roadmap plans to move away from Vanilla JS.
