## About

### Mission

## Getting started

Becoming a 🚀 reviewer takes 🤓, ❤️, and 💪.

The best reviews share insights that are not widely known by the majority of the community, but that would **save them hours of work to discover**.

For instance, not many people need to know that [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) is a great JavaScript runtime and that it is easy to set up.  Is there something about a particular implementation that you have discovered through experience that would help the community?  Perhaps there's an alternative, or a configuration that works well... or doesn't.

Great reviews often result from the ✨ in: 😓😓😓❤️😓😓😓💪😓😓😓✨✨🤓🚀

**Note:** an *experience* is not an *issue* (*issues* should be reported via a repo's **/issues** endpoint).

A **good place to start** is by reviewing [trending repositories that are under active development](https://github.com/trending).


## Contributing

The site is open source (here's all the code!) and is a tool _for_ and _by_ the community.

Submit [issues](https://github.com/repo-reviews/repo-reviews.github.io/issues/new) and [pull requests](https://github.com/repo-reviews/repo-reviews.github.io/compare/) for reviews, site ideas or copy edits.

We are actively recruiting developers (ruby/jekyll) and moderators.  Interested?  Post an issue and we will reach out.

### Under the Hood

This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), an open source static site generator. This means the Jekyll program takes the content we want to be on the site and turns them into HTML files ready to be hosted somewhere. Awesomely, GitHub provides free web hosting for repositories, called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and that's how this site is hosted.
