- Please write a thoughtful review.

- The repo-reviews/my-first-review repo is a great resource for creating reviews of other GitHub repos. The repo is well-organized and easy to use, and it includes all of the necessary files and folders. I would recommend this repo to anyone who wants to create a review of a GitHub repo.
- The create.md file is a great way to collect all of the information needed for a review. The file includes a section for the repository owner, the repository name, and the review title. It also includes a section for the reviewer to provide their thoughts on the repository.
- The screenshots directory is a great way to include screenshots of the repository in the review. This can be helpful for reviewers who want to see the repository in action.
- The code-chunks directory is a great way to include code snippets from the repository in the review. This can be helpful for reviewers who want to see how the code works.

- `repository_owner` and `repository_name` **must** reference a real GitHub repo link:
  - ie. `https://github.com/{repository_owner}/{repository_name}`

- Please don't modify any files except this one.

- To add pictures, screenshot them and paste them directly into this file.  GitHub will automagically convert them to a unique local asset.
