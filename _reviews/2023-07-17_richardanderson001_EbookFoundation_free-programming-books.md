This is a great repo to get started both with programming and open-source.  It's one of GitHub's most popular repos.  It is almost like a library, so you have to know what book or at least what topic you are looking for a free programming book for.  If you are new to programming, it is probably easier to just begin by googleing an intoroductory course and then use the available books as supporting content.  Nevertheless, there are plenty of free ebooks entitled "Introduction to..." and there is a section on free online courses:

## Benefits

Exchaustive- this repo contains many languages, topics, lists, and meta-lists.  A great place to browse.

Some of my favorite sections:

- [Cheat cheets section](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books)
- [Free courses](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/main/courses/free-courses-en.md)
- [](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/main/more/problem-sets-competitive-programming.md#competitive-programming)

## Drawbacks

Exhaustive- so many languages and topics sometimes it's hard for a newbie to see where to get started.  Being a great place to browse, it's easy to go down a rabbit-hole!

Some links are stale- but the repo moderators and contributors are very helpful and responsive in incorporating feedback.
