This is an interesting project that reminds me of the days of the Enlightenment window manager.  Currently at 9.6k stars, 55 watching, 346 forks.

Primarily developed by:

- https://github.com/vaxerski
  - Sponsor them at: https://ko-fi.com/vaxry
  - Seems burnt out on FOSS (https://blog.vaxry.net/articles/Maintaining%20FOSS%20Projects%20Sucks) and still taking exams
    - might not be long term support as this much talent is probably going to get a real job soon!

## pros
- active development
- plenty of documentations
- beautful interface, when it works

## cons
- no guaranteed support for NVidia GPUs
- currently 405 issues and many bugs listed-
- heavy development by one developer whose available FOSS time might be increasingly limited

Wonder about the benefits of this vs Xorg?  Would love to hear any other user experiences before deploying this on multiple machines.
