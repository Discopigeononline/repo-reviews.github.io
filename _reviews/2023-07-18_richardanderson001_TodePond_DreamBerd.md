## Summary

I find the DreamBerd GitHub repository to be both funny and insightful. The [README.md](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd#readme) file provides an overview of the presumably imaginary DreamBerd programming language, which is described as “perfect”. The language has several unique features, such as the use of exclamation marks to end statements, four types of declarations (constant, constant variable, variable constant, and variable variable), and the ability to use any Unicode character or string as a variable or constant name. Arrays in DreamBerd start at -1, and it’s even possible to use floats for indexes.  Test coverage is currently at 109%... awesome.

I appreciate the creativity and humor behind the DreamBerd project and would recommend it to others looking for a lighthearted view at typical programming antipatterns.  

My favorite feature, new for 2023, is the Immutable Data and the `const const const` keyword.

## Pros

- if you understand why some of these items are funny, you're probably an experienced programmer
- plenty of [examples](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/blob/main/Examples.md)

## Cons

- if you don't understand why these items are funny, you will probably not enjoy this repo :)
- probably not the best use of your time if you're on the clock
