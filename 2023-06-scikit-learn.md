I'm a data scientist with 4 years of experience, and I've been using sklearn for 6 years now
The main problem I faced while start using sklearn, is the learning roadmap
I remember it like yesterday, a lot of new things, and I don't know where to start; I was really confused
Those two videos from sklearn creator helped me a lot [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kT6QOVSgSg), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLYzSas511I)

I recommend filming them more professionally, make as short video clips and put on their website
and also make more advanced tutorials as there are a lot of amazing things not well-known in the community
